				<h2>Where the Red Fern Grows Summary</h2>

                <p>
                    The adult Billy Colman narrates his childhood memories. Living with his Papa and Mama and three sisters in the Ozark Mountains in Oklahoma, all 10-year-old Billy wants is two hounds with whom he can hunt "coons" (racoons). His family cannot afford them, however, so Billy works odd jobs for two years and saves up the money to buy them. Only then does he tell his plan to his Grandpa, who helps arrange the purchase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After an initial adventure in which they scare off a mountain lion, Billy and his two hounds - a small, intelligent female dog he names Little Ann and a stronger, determined male dog he calls Old Dan - are inseparable. They learn all the angles of coon hunting and make a great team; no wily coon can outsmart Little Ann, and Old Dan is strong and sure. More than that, the dogs seem bonded to each other, and to Billy, in mysterious ways. Both dogs' lives are endangered at different points, but with bravery and intelligence they all help each other out of jams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One day, the cruel, trouble-making Pritchard boys bet Billy that his dogs, whose reputations grow with each new coonskin, cannot "tree" (chase up a tree, at which point the hunter usually chops down the tree) the elusive "ghost coon" in their neck of the woods. On the hunt, the elder Rubin accidentally falls on Billy's ax as he tries to kill Billy's dogs (who are fighting the Pritchards' dog). The incident haunts Billy. 
                </p>
                <p>

                    To cheer Billy up, Grandpa enters him in a championship coon hunt. Billy, Grandpa, and Papa go to the contest. Immediately, Little Ann wins the beauty contest. Billy qualifies for the championship round in which his dogs bag three coons, but a blizzard sets in as they chase away a fourth one necessary for the win. The men eventually find the half-frozen dogs circling a treed coon. When they kill the fourth coon, they win the championship and the $300 jackpot.
                </p>
                <p>

                    The family is ecstatic over Billy's success, and Mama is especially grateful for the money. But some weeks after the championship, Billy and the dogs encounter a mountain lion. The dogs save Billy's life, and they manage to kill it, but not before it inflicts serious damage on Old Dan. He dies, and without him, Little Ann loses the will to live and dies a few days later. Billy buries them next to each other and cannot understand why God took them from him.
                </p>
                <p>

                    With the money the dogs have earned over time from the coonskins and the jackpot, the family can finally move to town in the spring and the children can receive an education. On the day they move, Billy revisits his dogs' graves. He finds a red fern has sprouted up between the two mounds. He knows the Indian legend about a little boy and girl who had been lost in a blizzard and froze to death. When their bodies were found in the spring, a red fern had sprouted between them. As the legend goes, only an angel can plant the seeds of a red fern, which never dies and makes the spot sacred.
                </p>
                <p>

                    The adult Billy reflects that he would like to revisit the Ozarks and all his childhood haunts. He is sure the red fern is still there, larger now, for he believes its legend.

                    Where the Red Fern Grows Character List
                </h2>
                <h4>

                    Billy
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The protagonist and narrator of the novel, 10-year-old Billy loves his dogs and coon hunting more than anything. He is also a sensitive, likable young man who cares deeply about his family and meditates frequently upon faith and death. Though he is a great coon hunter, he ultimately cares more about his dogs than about success; they have a loving bond that goes beyond mere loyalty.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Little Ann
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Little Ann is Billy's female hound. She more than makes up for her small size with her great intelligence; no coon can outsmart her diligent tracking. She loves Billy and Old Dan; she will not hunt without them, and stays by Old Dan's side no matter what.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Old Dan
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Billy's beloved male hound, Old Dan is small but muscular. He is also brave and exceedingly determined; he never gives up a chase, and often he must be forcibly removed from the hunt. He hunts only with Billy and Little Ann, and he and Little Ann have a mystical connection to each other.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Grandpa
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Billy's Grandpa runs a store and is instrumental in many of Billy's hunting accomplishments. He gives Billy work and helps arrange for Billy's purchase of the hounds, and he enters them in the championship coon hunt. Grandpa is a mischievous character, cracking jokes and proudly telling tall tales about his grandson's exploits. His understanding of Billy's love for his dogs makes Billy closer with him.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Papa
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Billy's Papa is a solidly moral man who always tries to do good for others. When Rubin dies, Papa is the first to help out. Papa respects Billy's boundaries; he understands that Billy is growing up and needs to do certain things, especially those related to his dogs, on his own. Papa wants the best for Billy and his family, and his hope is to move the family to town so his children can receive an education.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Mama
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Billy's Mama loves him deeply and constantly frets over his safety in his hunting adventures. However, she understands how important hunting and the hounds are to Billy. Billy often has his most reflective conversations about death and spirituality with her. Her dream is to move the family to town and get an education for her children.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Rubin Pritchard
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Two years older than Billy, the dangerously quiet Rubin is cruel and disrespectful to Grandpa. He accidentally kills himself while out hunting with Billy.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Rainie Pritchard
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Billy's age, Rainie is excessively violent and nervous. He is shocked after Rubin's accident and cannot speak.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Billy's three sisters
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Billy has great affection and love for his three sisters, who love him and his dogs - especially Little Ann. He dotes most on the youngest.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Where the Red Fern Grows Themes
                </h2>
                <h4>
                    Determination
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Nearly every action by Billy and his dogs is an exercise in determination. To start with, Billy demonstrates great determination in simply getting his dogs - he works odd jobs for two years to save up enough money to buy the hounds, then walks through the night to pick up his hounds. The dogs return the favor. Little Ann does not deviate from the trail of a coon, whereas Old Dan never gives up the chase - Billy has to force him away. If Billy ever falters in his will power - as when he has to chop down the big sycamore for the dogs' first coon - his love for his hounds restores his determination. Many characters comment on the persistence of the dogs, notably during the championship hunt in the blizzard. Old Dan is determined until the very end - Billy must pry away his jaws from the mountain lion. Only after Old Dan dies does Little Ann show a loss of will power, but this is because she and Old Dan - and Billy - were a team who fed off the others' strong determination.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    God and spirituality
                </h4>
                <p>

                    Billy prays to God throughout the novel in difficult times, and his prayers are usually answered. He often discusses prayer with his parents, and feels God is somehow on his and his dogs' side. However, his faith is shaken when his dogs die, as he cannot understand why they were taken from him. The killing of the mountain lion, known as the "devil cat," seems tinged with religious themes and provides some kind of answer; the dogs have rid the environment of evil and made it a safe place. They are rewarded with the sacred red fern, which restores Billy's faith. He believes they had a mystical purpose on earth, and he can better understand their deaths.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Sacrifice
                </h4>
                <p>
                    We see many instances of selfless sacrifice in the novel, and often one sacrifice leads to another. Whenever Grandpa gives Billy candy, for instance, Billy gives it to his sisters. Charity is also crucial to the novel, as characters constantly help each other. Hunters buy Billy's wares when he is saving up money for the hounds, Billy's family often helps him, and during the championship hunt all the men help Billy out in the blizzard. But the deepest sacrifice is that of Old Dan and Little Ann for Billy. Old Dan sacrifices his life (as does Little Ann, by extension) for Billy in the fight against the mountain lion. The sacrifice turns out to be not just for Billy, but for all the animals in the woods terrorized by the mountain lion and for the Colman family - thanks to Old Dan and Little Ann, they now have enough money to move to town.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Love beyond loyalty
                </h4>
                <p>

                    A character notes that Billy's hounds seem to have more than just loyalty for their owner; they love him deeply. This love is affirmed throughout the novel and contributes to the sad ending. Throughout their adventures, we see how love, and not mere loyalty, enables the team to survive and succeed. It is almost as if Billy, Old Dan, and Little Ann are one being. Rawls uses the color red throughout Where the Red Fern Grows. Red is the color of blood, as well, and through this association it symbolizes the dogs' deep love, their strong will power, and their sacrificial intimacy with each other and Billy - not to mention the mystical qualities of the red fern.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Family
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Billy is very close to his family. They support him whenever he needs it, and the unspoken message is that the family bonds together at all costs during the economic hardship of the Great Depression in the 1930s. Billy is perhaps closest to his Grandpa, who teaches him all he knows about coon hunting and is his greatest hunting supporter. At one point, Billy notes that no one can know a boy like his grandfather, and their relationship is possibly the most humorous, and meaningful, one in the novel.
